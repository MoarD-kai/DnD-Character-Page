		<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
			Born to a place of wonder and magic, Baki Nalani was the next in line to inherit the "Way of the Nalani", and go off to complete heroic deeds in the
			name of Ilmater. He was never too found of this future as he was far more carefree about his goals in life and wanted nothing more than to live as 
			impulsive as he wished. That all changed when his parents died, and he was forced to train alongside his senile, yet incredibly strict and powerful 
			grandfather who took no prisoners in discipling Baki in the ways of Ilmater's dogma. When he passed he decided to take his teachings from his home
			in the Feywild, and travel to different planes of existance to help those in need and to stop evil where it lay.
