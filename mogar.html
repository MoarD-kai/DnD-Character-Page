		<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
			Mogar Bloodkin, the weakest and youngest born to a chief of a warrior tribe known as the "Bloodkin". He had to constantly try to prove himself among his kin.
			Time after time he would fail to prove his worth, and time and time again he would have to stand back up to face his defeat. This taught him great humility,
			however there was no place for someone weak in a tribe of warriors. He was outcasted not just by his own tribe, but by his father's hand he was cast away.
			Now he seeks to grow stronger to prove his tribe wrong, and take his honor as a warrior back.
