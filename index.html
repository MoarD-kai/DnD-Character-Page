	<h2> Summary</h2>
	<p> 
	Of Brass and Burning is a campaign or story using the elements of the popular tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons. It is itself centered in a country known for its rich history in conflict and corruption known as Calimshan. 
	Calimshan is the perfect kind of corrupt, secretive, and dangerous place for shadows to lurk around in every corner, and they most certainly do. 
	In the midst of all the outer turmoil among the masses there is a hidden darkness that threatens not just the country itself, but the multiverses themselves. 
	This darkness is the threat known as the Twisted Rune.
	</p>
	<h2> Gameplay</h2>
	<p> 
	As previously stated the game uses the rules and setip of Dungeons and Dragons, however we are too far from one another to play in person. So how do 
	we manage to keep this game a weekly occurance: <a href="https://roll20.net/">Roll20</a>. Roll20 is a website that allows the access of the tabletop elements from the comfort of your computer, 
	and we use this to setup our maps, roll dice, and overall create the visual part of the narrative. There are 3 players and a dungeon master or the person who makes the world. 
	The players are free to make their own decisions befitting their character(s), but overall we are trying to stop the Twisted Rune from destroying reality as we know, and along the way we meet
	powerful allies, enemies, and collect artifacts and information to make us strong enough to fight against these reality ending antagonists.
