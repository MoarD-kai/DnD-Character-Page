		<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
			Spawned in the lower plane of the Underdark, Vacelle was raised in the darkest pit of the multiverse, where corruption and underhandedness were a way
			of life. In her hometown she was an orphan who had gained that status through her parents finally collapsing from the strain of being worked to the bone
			as slaves by their drow and shadow dragon oppressors. She roamed the city of her origin as was found by a man who offered a choice: stick to her life of
			living under another's thumb, or learn to take back what belongs to you. From that day on she used her hate of her oppressors as fuel to train relentlessly
			as she grew stronger. Now she free from her oppressors and seeks to find and kill those who took her family from her.
